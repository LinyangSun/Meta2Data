bioproject	PRJNA953189	BioProject	[]	gut microbiome disruptions	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA953189	Bumblebees are crucial for both natural ecosystems and agriculture, but their decline in distribution and abundance over the past decade is alarming. The global importance of bumblebees in natural ecosystems and agricultural food production cannot be overstated. However, the reported decline in their distribution and abundance over the past decade has led to a surge of interest in understanding and addressing bumblebee population decline. Based on the role of bacterial symbionts in bee health we aimed to detect disruptions in the gut microbiome of male and worker bumble bees reared indoor and outdoor to identify assess potential resilience to environmental stress. Using the Illumina MiSeq platform for 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the gut microbiome of male and worker bees that were raised indoors (designated as the IM and IW group) and those that were raised outdoors (also designated as the OM and OW group). Our results show presence of core bacteria Neisseriaceae, Orbaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae from indoor reared worker bees. However, higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and absence of Fructobacillus from indoor reared worker bees was also observed. Indoor-reared male bees had lower diversity and fewer observed OTUs compared to outdoor-reared bees. Additionally, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes was significantly lower in indoor-reared males, while Proteobacteria was significantly increased. Despite this, we did not observe any dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of indoor-reared bumblebees when comparing the role of the gut symbionts among the groups. These results suggest that indoor-reared Bombus terrestris may be resilient to environmental stress when used as outdoor pollinators	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"Dong-A University","Accession":"PRJNA953189","Title":"gut microbiome disruptions","experimentList":[["SRA1617136","SRX19901751"],["SRA1617136","SRX19901752"],["SRA1617136","SRX19901753"],["SRA1617136","SRX19901754"],["SRA1617136","SRX19901755"],["SRA1617136","SRX19901756"]]}

Given the ecosystem functions performed by bees, and the declines faced by many species, it is important to improve our understanding of the amount of natural variation in the gut microbiome, the level of sharing of bacteria among co-occurring species (including between native and non-native species), and how gut communities respond to infections. We conducted 16S rRNA metabarcoding to discern the level of microbiome similarity between honey and bumble bee species in a suburban-rural landscape. We identified simple gut microbiomes dominated by bacterial taxa belonging to Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, and Lactobacillus. At the strain level, one G. apicola amplicon sequence variant (ASV 1) was widely shared across honey bees and bumble bees. However, we detected one G. apicola strain that was either exclusive to honey bees, or represented an intra-genomic 16S rRNA haplotype variant in honey bees. On the other hand, ASVs of S. alvi and Lactobacillus were more host specific, suggesting closer symbiotic relationships with their hosts. Honey bee bacterial microbiomes exhibited higher alpha diversity but lower beta and gamma diversities from those of bumble bees, a likely a result of the former possessing larger, perennial hives. Finally, we identified pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria that associate with Trypanosome and/or Vairimorpha infections in bees.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"George Mason University","Accession":"PRJNA874076","Title":"Gut metagenome raw sequence reads from Apis mellifera and Bombus spp.","experimentList":[["SRA1568288","SRX18913314"],["SRA1568288","SRX18913315"],["SRA1568288","SRX18913313"],["SRA1568288","SRX18913317"],["SRA1568288","SRX18913318"],["SRA1568288","SRX18913316"]]}

However, evolved inter-dependencies between hosts and their microbiomes are vulnerable to disturbances. Here, we experimentally transferred microbiomes from one honey bee worker generation to the next under antibiotic stress. This dietary stress led to a dysbiosis of the bee microbiome. In a final cycle naive bees with these pre-exposed microbiomes but never receiving antibiotics themselves showed increased mortality under high stress as well as changes in gene expression. This demonstrates inheritable effects of the disturbed microbiome onto host phenotypes.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"okinawa institute of science and technology","Accession":"PRJNA863631","Title":"Antibiotics induce transgenerational dysbiosis in the honey bee gut microbiome","experimentList":[["SRA1479124","SRX17150821"],["SRA1479124","SRX17150823"],["SRA1479124","SRX17150824"],["SRA1479124","SRX17150822"],["SRA1479124","SRX17150826"],["SRA1479124","SRX17150827"]]}

Brood parasitism however allows to distinguish between microbiome components horizontally transmitted by spill-over from the host with such inherited through vertical transmission by mothers. Here, we studied the bacterial gut microbiome of adults in seven aculeate species in four brood parasite-host systems: two bee-mutillid (host-parasitoid) systems, one halictid bee-cuckoo bee system and one wasp-chrysidid cuckoo wasp system. We aimed to test 1) whether host phylogeny correlates with bacterial gut microbiome composition, 2) whether brood parasites share components with their hosts, and 3) whether brood parasites show differences in bacterial diversity and specialization compared with respective hosts. Our results indicate that the bacterial gut microbiome of the studied taxa was species-specific, yet with a limited effect of phylogenetic relatedness and a major contribution of shared microbes between hosts and parasites. However, contrasting patterns emerged between bee-parasite systems and the wasp-parasite system. We conclude that the gut microbiome in adult brood parasites is largely affected by their host relationships and the similarity of trophic food sources between hosts and parasites.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"University of Munich (LMU)","Accession":"PRJNA862864","Title":"Bacterial gut microbiomes of aculeate brood parasites overlap with their aculeate hosts', but have higher diversity and specialization","experimentList":[["SRA1463471","SRX16690442"],["SRA1463471","SRX16690441"],["SRA1463471","SRX16690444"],["SRA1463471","SRX16690445"],["SRA1463471","SRX16690446"],["SRA1463471","SRX16690447"]]}

bioproject	PRJNA809353	BioProject	[]	Honey bee core hindgut microbiome transmission does not require social interaction: The effect of diet and social exposure on tissue-specific microbiome assembly	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA809353	Honey bees are a model for host-microbial interactions with experimental designs evolving towards conventionalized worker bees. Research on gut microbiome transmission and assembly has examined only a fraction of factors associated with the colony and hive environment. Here we studied the effects of diet and social isolation on tissue-specific bacterial and fungal colonization of the midgut and two key hindgut regions. We found that both treatment factors significantly influenced early hindgut colonization explaining similar proportions of microbiome variation. In agreement with previous work, social interaction with older workers was unnecessary for core hindgut bacterial transmission. Exposure to natural eclosion and fresh stored pollen resulted in gut bacterial communities that were taxonomically and structurally equivalent to those produced in the natural colony setting. Stressed diets of no pollen or altered pollen in social isolation resulted in atypical microbiome structure and tissue-specific variation of functionally important core bacteria. However, no exposure to the active hive environment markedly reduced the abundance of both fungi and keystone species Gilliamella apicola in the ileum. These changes were associated with significantly larger ileum microbiotas suggesting that extended exposure to the active hive environment plays an antibiotic role in hindgut microbiome establishment. We conclude that core hindgut microbiome transmission is facultative horizontal with 5 of 6 core hindgut species readily acquired from the built hive structure and natural diet. Our findings contribute novel insights into factors influencing assembly and maintenance of honey bee gut microbiota and facilitate future experimental designs.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"United States Department of Agriculture","Accession":"PRJNA809353","Title":"Honey bee core hindgut microbiome transmission does not require social interaction: The effect of diet and social exposure on tissue-specific microbiome assembly","experimentList":[["SRA1376325","SRX14263080"],["SRA1376325","SRX14263081"],["SRA1376325","SRX14263079"],["SRA1376325","SRX14263082"],["SRA1376325","SRX14263083"],["SRA1376325","SRX14263084"]]}
bioproject	PRJNA805022	BioProject	[]	Developmental microbiome of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA805022	The importance of the holobiont has been studied across many bee species, but less is known about the changes in the microbiome throughout the course of development, particularly in subsocial bees. This study used 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing of pollen provisions and individuals of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, across stages of development to characterize the composition and diversity of bacteria and fungi in the microbiome. Pollen provisions and larval stages showed similar beta diversity, but differences in taxa composition. There was no significant decrease in diversity during the transition between larval and pupal stages that was expected post defecation. However, there were unexpected and progressive declines in diversity as development progressed from the early to late pupal stages, and again from the callow to adult stages. Bees across all stages lacked members of the Lactobacillus (now Apilactobacillus) genus, which has been shown in other studies to be part of the core bacterial community in C. calcarata and all bees. Three correlations between bacteria and fungi were found, suggesting common beneficial bacteria may protect the bees from prevalent fungal pathogens. Low alpha diversity, particularly in the later stages of development through adulthood, is concerning as the microbiome plays an important role in maintaining wild bee health.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"York University","Accession":"PRJNA805022","Title":"Developmental microbiome of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata","experimentList":[["SRA1372008","SRX14164662"],["SRA1372008","SRX14164663"],["SRA1372008","SRX14164664"],["SRA1372008","SRX14164668"],["SRA1372008","SRX14164667"],["SRA1372008","SRX14164670"]]}
bioproject	PRJNA801280	BioProject	[]	A propolis-rich hive environment affects redox gene expression and microbiota at the individual and social level in honey bees	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA801280	The honey bee worker gut microbiome plays a critical role in host physiology including immunity, oxidative state and disease susceptibility. Here we investigated the effects of propolis (collected tree resin mixed with beeswax) on size and composition of gut microbiota, and host worker immune and redox gene expression. Using full-sized colonies, we prompted workers to collect tree resin creating a naturally propolis-rich colony/hive environment. Sampling pre-marked adult worker bees at 9-days post emergence revealed significantly larger populations of bacteria in the worker gut, but little change in the taxonomic composition or relative structure of the gut microbiome compared to propolis-poor colonies. Although immune gene expression in the fat body did not differ significantly, we found an overall trend towards decreased expression of immune genes in propolis-rich colonies. The expression of both pro-phenol oxidase and catalase were significantly reduced in the worker fat body suggesting that propolis augments host redox balance in individual workers. Consistent with clinical trials on human subjects, increased propolis levels resulted in greater expression of superoxide dismutase from both social head glands and the individual worker fat body. Assuming that social head gland secretions contribute to social immunity and net redox activity throughout the social environment, our results are consistent with a companion paper reporting drastic increases in beneficial native bacteria and reduced microbial diversity on the mouthparts, a primary marker of social interaction. Our study suggests that propolis supplementation has a net positive effect on host-microbial health at both individual and social levels, and through the upregulation of internal and socially secreted enzymes, may aid in the detoxification of biocides prevalent throughout the pollination environment.	2025-09-28T11:05:05.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"United States Department of Agriculture","Accession":"PRJNA801280","Title":"A propolis-rich hive environment affects redox gene expression and microbiota at the individual and social level in honey bees","experimentList":[["SRA1363206","SRX13953875"],["SRA1363206","SRX13953876"],["SRA1363206","SRX13953877"],["SRA1363206","SRX13953878"],["SRA1363206","SRX13953879"],["SRA1363206","SRX13953880"]]}

A healthy gut microbiome is tied to central metabolism, provides protection from pathogens, aids in detoxification, and primes the immune system. Among the worker caste, age-based polytheism dictates the division of labor and is also integral to colony success. Independent of age, the honey bee worker can assume various physiological/behavioral roles based on colony needs. We investigated the disruption of worker age demographics on the ileum and rectum (hindgut) microbiomes, specifically, we forced foragers to revert to nursing; a task associated with youthful physiology. We hypothesized that the repeated consumption of pollen would result in oxidative stress and alterations to the microbiota. We found that the core hindgut microbiome remained relatively stable, with the exception of two putative opportunistic bacteria that differed by treatment. Associated with increased expression of prophenoloxidase (PPO) in reverted foragers, we observed the formation of diverticula in the midgut suggesting a loss of gut integrity. Collectively, our results suggest stability of the hindgut microbiome, but senescence of the midgut with reversion phenotypes becoming susceptible to septicemia.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"United States Department of Agriculture","Accession":"PRJNA774758","Title":"The effect of social reversion on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) hindgut microbiota","experimentList":[["SRA1318828","SRX12803734"],["SRA1318828","SRX12803732"],["SRA1318828","SRX12803737"],["SRA1318828","SRX12803735"],["SRA1318828","SRX12803736"],["SRA1318828","SRX12803740"]]}

bioproject	PRJNA742765	BioProject	[]	Social Immunity in Aging Workers of Apis mellifera: Microbiota, Social Gene Expression and Disease Susceptibility in Honey Bee Colonies Overwinter.	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA742765	Overwintering is a major contributor to honey bee colony loss worldwide and involves changes in environmental conditions, host physiology and behavior that render individuals more susceptible to disease. Aging, climate and social gene expression are all expected to play a major role in disease susceptibility throughout the winter months. Here we used a marked cohort of known-age worker honey bees to investigate the integrity of mouthpart and midgut microbiomes of overwintering workers at 19, 33, 50, and 70 days of age. We quantified gene expression associated with oxidative stress and social immunity from a mouthpart associated secretory (hypopharygeal) gland that interfaces with the extended social environment on many levels. Our results provide the first evidence that social immune expression is associated with the core gut microbiota in honey bees, and highlights the midgut as a vulnerable tissue overwinter in warm southern climates. Results suggest many microbiota centric hypotheses including cooperation, competition, and social hygienic host response to hive opportunists. We discovered a distinct physiological and microbiological trajectory of southern diutinus (long-lived) workers that differs drastically from the younger, short-lived workers in the colony. Antioxidant gene expression in aging bees was associated with decreased fungal load on the mouth, increases in core microbiota and increased longevity. The cold indoor overwintering environment was associated with a small and stable midgut microbiota structure and stable gene expression overwinter. In contrast, warm outdoor overwintering was associated with changes co-occurring throughout the alimentary tract microbiota that suggest both disease presence and resistance in older workers, but increased disease susceptibility for younger workers that emerged during the winter, including increases in Enterobacteriaceae, fungal load and other bacterial opportunists. Our results highlight social selection pressures that shaped the microbiome with evolution to a perennial life history.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"United States Department of Agriculture","Accession":"PRJNA742765","Title":"Social Immunity in Aging Workers of Apis mellifera: Microbiota, Social Gene Expression and Disease Susceptibility in Honey Bee Colonies Overwinter.","experimentList":[["SRA1253780","SRX11332105"],["SRA1253780","SRX11332106"],["SRA1253780","SRX11332107"],["SRA1253780","SRX11332109"],["SRA1253780","SRX11332110"],["SRA1253780","SRX11332108"]]}

Owing to their foraging and honey production activities, honeybees form complex relationships with species across all domains, such as plants, viruses, bacteria (symbiotic and pathogenic), and other hive pests, making honey a valuable biomonitoring tool for assessing their ecological niche. The application of honey shotgun metagenomics has paved the way for a detailed description of the species honeybees interact with, in order to better assess the multiple factors governing their health. We describe the implementation of optimized honey DNA extraction methodology coupled to direct shotgun metagenomics (Direct-SM) analysis, and to a computationally optimised and validated pipeline for taxonomic classification of species detected in honey. By comparing honey collected across 3 harvesting seasons in a stable apiary, we show that Direct-SM can describe the variability of sampled plant species, revealing honeybee behavioural adaptation. We reveal that Direct-SM can non-invasively capture the diversity of species comprising the core and non-core bacterial communities of the gut microbiome. We show that this methodology is applicable for the monitoring of pathogens and particularly for the biomonitoring varroa infestation. These results suggest that Direct-SM can accurately and comprehensively describe honeybee ecological niches and can be deployed to assess bee health in the field.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":0,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"BSRC Alexander Fleming","Accession":"PRJNA735927","Title":"Bee foraging preferences, microbiota and pathogens revealed by direct shotgun metagenomics of honey","experimentList":[["SRA1242061","SRX11090824"],["SRA1242061","SRX11090825"],["SRA1242061","SRX11090826"],["SRA1242061","SRX11090827"],["SRA1242061","SRX11090828"],["SRA1242061","SRX11090829"]]}

Information on such adaptations beyond morphological features are currently sparse for insects, and especially bees. Here, we used molecular methods to study hidden traits, biotic interactions and phylogenetic relationships of halictid bees of the genus Lasioglossum along a 2,900 m elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We detected a strong phylogenetic species turnover of morphologically undistinguishable taxa, changes in cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles, pollen resource diversity and the gut and body surface microbiome of bees. At high elevations increased proportions of saturated compounds in CHC profiles indicate physiological adaptations to prevent desiccation. More specialised diets with higher proportions of Asteraceae pollen imply constraints by food resources. Interactive effects of climatic conditions on gut and surface microbiomes, CHC profiles and pollen diet suggest complex feedbacks among abiotic conditions, ecological interactions, physiological adaptations and phylogentic constraints as drivers of halictid bee communities at Mt. Kilimanjaro.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"University of Wuerzburg","Accession":"PRJNA719282","Title":"Halictines at the Mt Kilimanjaro","experimentList":[["SRA1214615","SRX10503565"],["SRA1214615","SRX10503566"],["SRA1214615","SRX10503564"],["SRA1214615","SRX10503568"],["SRA1214615","SRX10503569"],["SRA1214615","SRX10503567"]]}

Modern commercial beekeeping is faced with a variety of pathogenic and environmental stressors often confounding attempts to understand recent colony loss. European foulbrood (EFB) is a larval disease whose causative agent, Melissococcus plutonius, has received limited attention due to methodological challenges in the field and laboratory. Here we improve the experimental and informational context of larval disease with the end goal of developing an EFB management strategy. We sequenced the bacterial microbiota associated with larval disease transmission, isolated a variety of M. plutonius strains, determined their virulence against larvae in vitro, and explored the potential for probiotic treatment of EFB disease. The larval microbiota was a low diversity environment similar to honey, while worker mouthparts and stored pollen contained significantly greater bacterial diversity. Virulence of M. plutonius against larvae varied markedly by strain and inoculant concentration.

bioproject	PRJNA494922	BioProject	[]	Characterisation of the UK honey bee metagenome	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA494922	The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) plays a major role in pollination and food production, but is under threat from emerging pathogens and agro-environmental insults. As with other organisms, honey bee health is a complex product of environment, host genetics and associated microbes (commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic). Improved understanding of bee genetics and their molecular ecology can help manage modern challenges to bee health and production. Sampling bee and cobiont genomes, we characterised the metagenome of 19 honey bee colonies across Britain. Low heterozygosity was observed in bees from many Scottish colonies, sharing high similarity to the native dark bee, A. mellifera mellifera. Apiaries exhibited high diversity in the composition and relative abundance of individual microbiome taxa. Most non-bee sequences derived from known honey bee commensal bacteria or known pathogens, e.g. Lotmaria passim (Trypanosomatidae), and Nosema spp. (Microsporidia). However, DNA was also detected from numerous additional bacterial, plant (food source), protozoan and metazoan organisms. To classify sequences from cobionts lacking genomic information, we developed a novel network analysis approach clustering orphan contigs, allowing the identification of Apicystis bombi, a parasitic gregarine. Our analyses demonstrate the power of high-throughput, directed metagenomics in agroecosystems identifying potential threats to honey bees present in their microbiota.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"University of Edinburgh","Accession":"PRJNA494922","Title":"Characterisation of the UK honey bee metagenome","experimentList":[["SRA791052","SRX4819381"],["SRA791052","SRX4819382"],["SRA791052","SRX4819384"],["SRA791052","SRX4819385"],["SRA791052","SRX4819383"],["SRA791052","SRX4819387"]]}

The goals of this study were to compare the hepatic transcriptome and PBDE metabolism between conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice.
Methods: Livers from vehicle (corn oil), BDE-47, or BDE-99 treated adult male CV and GF mice were used for RNA-Seq (biological replicates: n=3 for CV corn oil, n=4 for CV BDE-47, n=2 for CV BDE-99, n=3 for GF corn oil, n=3 for GF BDE-47, and n=3 for BDE-99) using a HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT v 0.1.6 beta; transcript abundance and differential expression were determined using Cufflinks (CuffDiff) v 2.2.1.
Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow,RNA-Seq generated approximately 47 to 68 million reads per sample, among which approximately 40 to 60 million reads were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI GRCm/38/mm10). And we identified 393 drug processing genes in the livers of WT and hCAR-TG with  with HISAT workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed that among all the 393 DPGs with known important functions in xenobiotic biotransformation, 90 DPGs were not expressed in livers of any groups (threshold: average FPKM < 1 in all treatment groups); whereas a total of 303 genes were expressed in livers of at least one groups, among which 258 DPGs were differentially regulated by mCAR or hCAR activation in either Day 5 or Day 60 (FDR-BH<0.05), and 45 genes were stably expressed among all treatment groups.
Conclusions: Our study has unveiled a novel interaction between gut microbiome and the hepatic biotransformation of PBDEs, demonstrating that germ-free conditions modified the hepatic oxidation of PBDEs as well as the expression of relevant drug-processing genes in liver.
Overall design: CV and GF male mice at the age of 9-weeks were treated with corn oil, BDE-47 (100umol/kg), or BDE-99 (100umol/kg) once daily for 4 consecutive days,  and tissues were collected 24h after the final dose. Total RNAs were isolated from livesr using RNA zol bee reagent, and were subjected to RNA-Seq using a HiSeq 2000 sequencer.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"ModelOrganism","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Transcriptome or Gene expression","Organization":"Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, University of Washington","Accession":"PRJNA395063","Title":"Novel Interactions between Gut Microbiome and Host Drug-processing Genes Modify the Hepatic Metabolism of the Environmental Chemicals PBDEs","experimentList":[["SRA588938","SRX3020126"],["SRA588938","SRX3020127"],["SRA588938","SRX3020128"],["SRA588938","SRX3020129"],["SRA588938","SRX3020130"],["SRA588938","SRX3020131"]]}

bioproject	PRJNA321197	BioProject	[]	Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Raw sequence reads	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA321197	The importance of gut microbial communities for animal health has become increasingly clear. Early gut succession and diet-related shifts in bacterial community composition can be associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Here we determined the effect of host niche and nutrient source on gut bacterial composition of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). We provided caged bees with naturally collected pollen and pollen substitute, both fresh and aged, then recorded host development and bacterial community composition of four nutrient-processing host niches. Feeding fresh pollen or fresh substitute, we found no difference in host mortality, consumption rate, development, or microbial community composition. In contrast, bees fed aged nutrition differed markedly, suffering impaired development, increased mortality, and developed a significantly different microbiome throughout the alimentary tract. Consuming an aged nutrient source resulted in a significant reduction of the core ileum bacterium Snodgrassella alvi and a corresponding increase of opportunistic pathogen Frischella perrara. Moreover, the relative abundance of S. alvi in the ileum was positively correlated with host survival and development. The inverse was true for F. perrara, reinforcing its role as an opportunistic gut pathogen. Echoing results from bumble bees, Parasacharibacter apium was also associated with negative host effects in general. Collectively, our findings suggest that the early establishment of S. alvi is associated with healthy nurse development, potentially excluding F. perrara and P. apium from the ileum. The pattern of dysbiosis in the ileum was reflected in the rectum, mouthparts and hypopharyngeal glands, suggesting a systemic physiological response. Our findings provide insight into the role nutrition plays in host health and the establishment of a characeristic gut microbiome.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"ModelOrganism","experimentsMore":0,"Center":"SRA","Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"United States Department of Agriculture","Accession":"PRJNA321197","Title":"Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Raw sequence reads","experimentList":[["SRA424673","SRX1755991"],["SRA424673","SRX1755990"]]}

bioproject	PRJNA252811	BioProject	[]	Honeybee and beebread microbiome Metagenome	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA252811	Many insects (i.e. termites, leaf-cutter ants, aphids, etc.) have evolved non-pathogenic associations with microorganisms that provide beneﬁts for both partners. The microbial gut community of Apis mellifera might be involved in nutritional processes, such as breakdown and utilization of pollen grains, degradation of toxic compounds found in the environment and hampering pathogens development. Although evidences of changes in the nutritional composition of pollen guided by microbial activity exist, the microbiota actively involved in this process (inhabiting the beebread and guts of A. mellifera) were not yet totally identified. This survey aimed to assess the diversity and structure as well as to estimate the function of the microbial communities inhabiting both the bee guts and the beebread by using state of the art ‘post-light’ based sequencing technology. The 16S rRNA database was used to predict the microbial functions within the bee gut and the beebread by.

Therefore, understanding how factors, such host genetics and social environment, impact the establishment and composition of the gut microbiota can provide insight into host biological functioning. Here, we controlled the microbial inoculation of honey bees across distinct social groups, each composed of a mixture of bees from three distinct genetic backgrounds, to determine the relative effects of host genetic background and social environment on the establishment and composition of the gut microbiota. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that host genetic background and social environment had effects on gut microbiome structure, with each influencing gut microbiome beta diversity. In addition, host genetic background and social environment each affected the abundance of different individual gut microbes. Together, these results suggest that host genetic background and social environment may play distinct roles in shaping the establishment and structure of host gut microbiota.	2025-12-25T12:30:41.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":0,"Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"University of Wisconsin-Stout","Accession":"PRJNA1307180","Title":"Host genetic background and social environment have different effects on the establishment and structure of the adult worker honey bee gut microbiota","experimentList":[]}

bioproject	PRJNA1036403	BioProject	[]	Unveiling climate- and resource-driven Variation in Bumble Bee Gut Microbiomes: Perspectives from Elevational Gradients, Colony Translocation, and Climate Chamber Experiments	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJNA1036403	Rising temperatures negatively affect bumble bee fitness directly through effects on physiology, but they may also disrupt mutualistic interactions between bees and other organisms, which ultimately determine species-specific response to climate change. Gut symbionts, key regulators of host nutrition and health, may be the Achilles' heel of thermal responses in insects. They not only modulate biotic interactions with plants and pathogens but also exhibit varying thermal sensitivity themselves. Understanding microbiome community disruption due to environmental change is a crucial first step to determine potential consequences for host population responses. Here, we analysed the gut bacteria communities of six bumble bee species inhabiting different climatic niches along an elevational gradient in the German Alpes, using 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing. We first investigated whether inter- and intraspecific differences in gut bacterial communities can be linked to species' elevational niches, which differ e.g., in temperature, flower resource composition and, likely, pathogen pressure. With a reciprocal translocation experiment, attempted between two distinct climatic regions within Germany, we then tested in B. terrestris and B. lucorum, how gut bacterial communities of bumble bee workers change in short-term when exposing colonies to new environments. Finally, we exposed these species to heat and cold wave scenarios within climate chambers to disentangle pure temperature-driven effects on the microbiome from other environmental effects. Species-specific microbiome characteristics indicated strong evolutionary influences on microbial associations. E.g., the loss of gut microbiome stability, characterized species inhabiting predominantly high and cooler elevations. Short-term adjustment of the gut microbiome to a warmer region was more subtle and characterized by an uptake of Lactobacillaceae. However, the gut microbiomes of these bumble bees did not change under laboratory temperature scenarios. Cumulatively, our data suggest that the gut microbiome is rather altered by climate-related environmental conditions rather than by temperature effects alone, with bumble bees response to climate change being determined by prevailing species-specific differences that co-evolve over time.	2023-11-10T13:21:00.000Z	{"Relevance":"Environmental","experimentsMore":1,"Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"University of Munich (LMU)|Bavarian Climate Research Network","Accession":"PRJNA1036403","Title":"Unveiling climate- and resource-driven Variation in Bumble Bee Gut Microbiomes: Perspectives from Elevational Gradients, Colony Translocation, and Climate Chamber Experiments","experimentList":[["SRA1746477","SRX22389946"],["SRA1746477","SRX22389947"],["SRA1746477","SRX22389948"],["SRA1746477","SRX22389949"],["SRA1746477","SRX22389950"],["SRA1746477","SRX22389951"]]}

As in humans, the health of bees is influenced by their microbiome. The bacterium Snodgrassella alvi is a key member of the bee gut microbiome and has a role in excluding pathogens. Despite this importance, there are not currently any easy-to-use methods for modifying the S. alvi chromosome to study its genetics. To solve this problem, we developed a one-step procedure that uses electroporation and homologous recombination, which we term SnODIFY (Snodgrassella-specific One-step gene Deletion or Insertion to alter FunctionalitY). We used SnODIFY to create seven single-gene knockout mutants and recovered mutants for all constructs tested. Nearly all transformants had the designed genome modifications, indicating that SnODIFY is highly accurate. Mutant phenotypes were validated through knockout of Type 4 pilus genes, which led to reduced biofilm formation. We also demonstrate inserting heterologous sequences into the genome by integrating fluorescent protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirmed that genome modification is dependent on S. alvis endogenous RecA protein. Because it does not require expressing exogenous recombination machinery, SnODIFY is a straightforward, accurate, and lightweight method for genome editing in S. alvi. This workflow can be used to study the functions of S. alvi genes and to engineer this symbiont for applications, such as protecting honey bee health.	2024-04-23T10:26:35.000Z	{"Relevance":"Agricultural","experimentsMore":0,"Data Type":"Raw sequence reads","Organization":"The University of Texas at Austin","Accession":"PRJNA1017617","Title":"Single-step genome engineering in the bee gut symbiont Snodgrassella alvi","experimentList":[]}

Composition and stability of the gut microbiome are essential to maintaining a bumblebee's immune system and health. While bumblebees are key pollinators in agricultural landscapes, little is known about how gut microbial communities respond to anthropogenic changes. We used commercially produced colonies of buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) placed in three habitats. Whole guts (midgut, hindgut, and rectum) of B. terrestris specimens were dissected from the body and analyzed using 16S phylogenetic community analysis. We observed significantly different bacterial community composition between the agricultural landscapes (apple orchards and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) fields) and forest meadows, whereas differences in gut communities between the orchards and oilseed rape fields were nonsignificant. Bee-specific bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus, Snodgrassella and Gilliamella dominated gut communities of B. terrestris specimens. In contrast, the guts of B. terrestris from forest meadows were dominated by fructose-associated Fructobacillus spp., which may have been the result of high nectar concentrations in cold-climate-associated forest meadow flowers typical of the northernmost range of B. terrestris’s distribution. Bacterial communities of workers were the most diverse. At the same time, that of males and young queens were less diverse, possibly reflecting greater exposure to the colony's inner environment compared to the environment outside the colony, as well as bumblebee age. Our results suggest that habitat quality, exposure to environmental microbes, nectar quality and accessibility, and land use significantly affect gut bacterial composition in B. terrestris. This, in turn, may suggest survival and fitness implications for key pollinators.	2024-01-04T13:51:52.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Data Type":"Other","Organization":"Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre","Accession":"PRJEB48765","Title":"Fructobacillus in bumblebee microbiome","experimentList":[["ERA7238724","ERX6905247"],["ERA7237967","ERX6904964"],["ERA7237950","ERX6904947"],["ERA7237949","ERX6904946"],["ERA7238762","ERX6905532"],["ERA7237964","ERX6904961"]]}

It is part of a conserved microbiome that is composed of few core phylotypes and is essential for bee health and metabolism. Phylogenomic analyses using whole genome sequences of 75 Snodgrassella strains showed that they formed a monophyletic lineage within the Neisseriaceae family, that Snodgrassella isolates from Asian honeybees diverged early on from the other species in their evolution, that isolates from honeybees and bumblebees were well separated and that this genus consists of at least seven species. We propose to formally name two new Snodgrassella species that were isolated from bumblebees, i.e. Snodgrassella gandavensis sp. nov. and Snodgrassella communis sp. nov.  Possible evolutionary scenarios for 107 species or group specific genes revealed very limited evidence for horizontal gene transfer of these genes. Functional analyses revealed the importance of small proteins, defense mechanisms, amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism and carbohydrate transport and metabolism among these 107 specific genes.	2023-10-17T14:11:59.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Data Type":"Genome sequencing and assembly","Organization":"uliege","Accession":"PRJEB47378","Title":"Phylogenomic analyses of Snodgrassella isolates from honeybees and bumblebees reveals taxonomic and functional diversity","experimentList":[["ERA6044586","ERX6261463"],["ERA6044598","ERX6261467"],["ERA6044597","ERX6261466"],["ERA6044584","ERX6261462"],["ERA6044599","ERX6261468"],["ERA6044595","ERX6261464"]]}

Here we profiled the microbiome in returning forager bees from 10-12 hives in each of 6 apiaries across the southern half of Ireland, at early, middle and late time points in the 2019 season. Despite the wide range of geographical locations and forage available, apiary site was not the strongest determinant of the honey bee microbiome. However, there was clear clustering of the honey bee microbiome by time point across all apiaries, independent of which apiary was sampled. The clustering of microbiome by time was weaker although still significant in three of the apiaries, which may be connected to their geographic location and other external factors. The potential forage effect was strongest at the second timepoint (June-July) when the apiaries also displayed greatest difference in microbiome ecological diversity. We identified bacteria in the forager bee microbiome that correlated with hive health as measured by counts of larvae, bees, and honey production. These findings support the hypothesis that the global honey bee microbiome and its constituent species support thriving hives.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"APC Microbiome Institute","Accession":"PRJEB47333","Title":"Geographical and seasonal analysis of the honey bee microbiome","experimentList":[["ERA5993945","ERX6241146"],["ERA5993945","ERX6241147"],["ERA5993945","ERX6241148"],["ERA5993945","ERX6241149"],["ERA5993945","ERX6241150"],["ERA5993945","ERX6241151"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB45401	BioProject	[]	Beehive microbiome from pollen and honey	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB45401	Honey bees use plant material to manufacture their own food. These insect pollinators visit flowers repeatedly to collect nectar and pollen, which are shared with other hive bees to produce honey and beebread. While producing these products, beehives accumulate a tremendous amount of microbes, including bacteria that derive from plants and different parts of the honey bees’ body. In this study, we have conducted a 16S rDNA ion torrent sequencing analysis on honey and beebread samples that were collected from 15 beehives in the southeast of England. We have confirmed that honeybee products carry a significant variety of bacterial groups that comprise bee commensals, environmental bacteria and pathogens of plants and animals. Remarkably, this bacterial diversity differs amongst the beehives, suggesting a specific fingerprint that is affected, not only by the nectar and pollen gathered from local plants, but also from other environmental sources. Our results show that every hive possesses their own microbiome, and that honeybee products are valuable indicators of the bacteria present in the beehives and their surrounding environment.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh","Accession":"PRJEB45401","Title":"Beehive microbiome from pollen and honey","experimentList":[["ERA4594066","ERX5633361"],["ERA4594066","ERX5633362"],["ERA4594066","ERX5633360"],["ERA4594066","ERX5633364"],["ERA4594066","ERX5633365"],["ERA4594066","ERX5633363"]]}

Information on such adaptations beyond morphological features are currently sparse for insects, and especially bees. Here, we used molecular methods to study hidden traits, biotic interactions and phylogenetic relationships of halictid bees of the genus Lasioglossum along a 2,900 m elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We detected a strong phylogenetic species turnover of morphologically undistinguishable taxa, changes in cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles, pollen resource diversity and the gut and body surface microbiome of bees. At high elevations increased proportions of saturated compounds in CHC profiles indicate physiological adaptations to prevent desiccation. More specialised diets with higher proportions of Asteraceae pollen imply constraints by food resources.

bioproject	PRJEB38245	BioProject	[]	Turnover of nest bacterial microbiome in nests of deceased red mason bees	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB38245	Solitary bees are subject to a variety of pressures that cause severe population declines. Currently habitat loss, temperature shifts, agrochemical exposure, and new parasites have been identified as major threats. Knowledge about detrimental bacteria is however scarce, although they may disturb natural microbiomes, nest environments or harm the larvae directly. To address this gap, we investigated 12 Osmia bicornis nests with deceased and 31 nests with healthy larvae from the same localities in a 16S rDNA metabarcoding study. We sampled larvae, pollen provisions, and nest material and then contrasted bacterial community composition and diversity in healthy and deceased nests. We identified three bacterial taxa assigned to Paenibacillus spp. (closely related to P. pabuli/amylolyticus/xylanexedens), Sporosarcina spp. and Bacillus spp. as indicative for bacterial communities of deceased larvae. Furthermore, we isolated the Bacillus sp. strain from a deceased larva and used it to inoculate the pollen provision of healthy larvae. Comparing the larval bacterial microbiota of treated individuals with control individuals, we observed strong microbiota changes and enhanced mortality. This underlines the need for further investigation of detrimental bacterial in solitary bees, to understand their impact on bee population dynamics and the importance of their natural microbiome for controlling pathogenic bacteria.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"The University of Wurzburg","Accession":"PRJEB38245","Title":"Turnover of nest bacterial microbiome in nests of deceased red mason bees","experimentList":[["ERA2597133","ERX4099301"],["ERA2597133","ERX4099303"],["ERA2597133","ERX4099300"],["ERA2597133","ERX4099306"],["ERA2597133","ERX4099304"],["ERA2597133","ERX4099308"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB31847	BioProject	[]	Bee Pollination Modifies the Structure of the Seed Microbiota	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB31847	To date, little is known about the assembly of the seed microbiota. Some early microbial seed colonizers are transmitted from the maternal plant to the seed through the vascular system while other enter through the stigma. Thus, the seed microbiota, consists of microbes not only recruited from the vascular tissues of the plant, but also from the flower. Flowers are known to be a hub for microbial transmission between plants and insects. This floral-insect exchange opens the possibility for insect-transmitted bacteria to colonize the ovule and subsequently the seed, and to pass then into the next plant generation. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of insect pollination to the seed microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Brassica napus flowers were subjected to Apis and Osmia bee pollination, hand pollination or autonomous self pollination (ASP). Sequence analyses revealed that Apis pollination reduced the bacterial richness and diversity, increased the beta diversity amongst plants and introduced bee associated taxa. In contrast, Osmia pollination had minor effects on the seed microbiome. Insect pollination is therefore an ecological process involved in the transmission of bacteria from flower to seeds.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"IRHS","Accession":"PRJEB31847","Title":"Bee Pollination Modifies the Structure of the Seed Microbiota","experimentList":[["ERA1788108","ERX3272459"],["ERA1788108","ERX3272460"],["ERA1788108","ERX3272461"],["ERA1788108","ERX3272462"],["ERA1788108","ERX3272463"],["ERA1788108","ERX3272464"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB31610	BioProject	[]	Linking pollen foraging of megachilid bees to their nest bacterial microbiota	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB31610	Microbial profiling of the solitary bee nest environment is a challenging task due to the multiple aspects of the solitary bee ecology. Solitary bees build their nests by modifying the interior of natural cavities using various environmental materials and they provision them with food by importing collected pollen. As a result, the microbiota of the solitary bee nests depends on a variety of introduced materials. In order to characterize the extent to which introduced pollen affects the nest microbiome, we used metabarcoding of the ITS2 rDNA and the 16S rDNA to characterize the pollen composition and the bacterial communities of 100 solitary bee nest chambers belonging to seven megachilid species. Although the identity of each bee host species was the main driver of variance for the nest bacterial communities, pollen composition also had an effect on their structure. We found a weak correlation between bacterial and pollen alpha-diversity and significant interactions between the composition of pollen and that of the nest microbiota. This study contributes to the understanding of the association between foraging preferences and bacteria acquisition for solitary bees which cannot establish bacterial transmission routes through eusociality. This association may be essential for the successful offspring recruitment for this group of valuable pollinators.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"The University of Wurzburg","Accession":"PRJEB31610","Title":"Linking pollen foraging of megachilid bees to their nest bacterial microbiota","experimentList":[["ERA1758252","ERX3236029"],["ERA1758252","ERX3236030"],["ERA1758252","ERX3236031"],["ERA1758252","ERX3236032"],["ERA1758252","ERX3236033"],["ERA1758252","ERX3236034"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB27223	BioProject	[]	Microbiome community structure and succession in the nests of two megachilid bee genera	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB27223	Studies on honeybees have revealed bacterial taxa that are assumed to adopt key functions 	in the hive, in terms of nutrient uptake and immune responses. Despite the fact that solitary bees provide invaluable ecological services, the contribution of microbial communities to larval health, development and final fitness of adults is mainly unknown. To address this gap, we conducted a 16S meta-barcoding study including larvae and stored pollen in nest chambers from two different megachilid solitary bee genera. We tested how host taxonomy, environmental context and temporal stage during larval development determined the richness and composition of microbial communities. A total of 198 specimens of larvae as well as their pollen provisions from Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile rotundata and Megachile versicolor nests from different landscapes were investigated. Solitary bee microbiota in the nesting environment were much more diverse compared to eusocial bees and microbial communities were species-bound, rather than landscape dependent. We identified bacterial taxonomic units that showed consistent occurrence in the larvae and the pollen provisions within the same bee species and we unveiled others showing an abundance shift in line with progressing development and with that a dynamic change in overall bacterial community composition from egg-laying to hatching.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"The University of Wurzburg","Accession":"PRJEB27223","Title":"Microbiome community structure and succession in the nests of two megachilid bee genera","experimentList":[["ERA1516606","ERX2638348"],["ERA1516606","ERX2638349"],["ERA1516606","ERX2638351"],["ERA1516606","ERX2638350"],["ERA1516606","ERX2638347"],["ERA1516606","ERX2638353"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB23224	BioProject	[]	The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB23224	The gut microbiome is increasingly recognised as playing an integral role in the health and ecology of a wide variety of animal taxa. However, the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age, and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over four days. The gut bacterial communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in-nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that core members of the unique honey bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results provide evidence for an influence of task related local environment exposure on the honey bee gut microbial community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"European Molecular Biology Laboratory","Accession":"PRJEB23224","Title":"The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees","experimentList":[["ERA1471804","ERX2585449"],["ERA1471804","ERX2585448"],["ERA1471804","ERX2585452"],["ERA1471804","ERX2585453"],["ERA1471804","ERX2585451"],["ERA1471804","ERX2585455"]]}
bioproject	PRJEB1933	BioProject	[]	Microbiome assessment of two Osmia rufa nesting sites including larvae	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJEB1933	Microbial activity is known to have profound impact on bee ecology and physiology, both by beneficial and pathogenic effects. Active manipulation of microbial communities towards the beneficial organisms has been observed for several Hymenoptera. This is achieved by inoculation with specific bacteria or treatment with antimicrobial substances. Most information about such associations is available for hive building organisms, and especially the honey-bee. There, manipulations especially result in a very restricted diversity of microbes present within the direct environment of their offspring. Currently, solitary bee nests have not been regarded according to microbial diversity, although their larvae face a very different situation from those of social bees and differences are to be expected. With this study, we assessed the bacterial biodiversity present in nests of Osmia rufa, the red mason bee, by culture-independent pyrosequencing. We found a high diversity not comparable to that in well tended hives of honey-bees. Although we identified a variety of potentially interacting organisms, positvely as well as negatively, most of the bacteria seem to originate from environmental sources through incorporated nest building material. Despite this untreated components of nest chambers, we also have indications that active pollen treatment to manipulate bacterial communities by mother bees may have similar importance as in hive-bees.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":0,"Center":"ERA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"The University of Wurzburg","Accession":"PRJEB1933","Title":"Microbiome assessment of two Osmia rufa nesting sites including larvae","experimentList":[["ERA212626","ERX248503"],["ERA212626","ERX248502"]]}

bioproject	PRJDB12699	BioProject	[]	Honey bee larval and adult microbiome life stages are effectively decoupled with vertical transmission overcoming early life perturbations	https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/bioproject/browse/insdc/PRJDB12699	Microbiomes provide a range of benefits to their hosts which can lead to the coevolution of a joint ecological niche. However, holometabolous insects, some of the most successful organisms on Earth, occupy different niches throughout development, with larva and adults being physiologically and morphologically highly distinct. Furthermore, transition between the stages usually involves the loss of the gut microbiome since the gut is remodeled during pupation. We here tested whether vertical microbiome transmission can overcome perturbations of the larval microbiome in honey bees (Apis mellifera). We manipulated the gut microbiome of in vitro reared larvae and after pupation inoculated the emerged bees with adult microbiome to test whether adult and larval microbiome stages may be coupled (e.g., through immune priming). We performed 16S ampliconsequencing to describe the bacterial community and mRNA sequencing to check for gene expression differences in larval as well as adult treatments. Larval treatments differed in bacterial composition and abundance, depending on diet, which also drove larval gene expression. Nonetheless, adults converged on the typical core taxa and showed limited gene expression variation. This work demonstrates that honey bee adult and larval stages are effectively microbiologically decoupled, and the core adult microbiome is remarkably stable to early developmental perturbations. Combined with the transmission of the microbiome in early adulthood, this allows the formation of long-term host-microbiome associations.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","experimentsMore":1,"Center":"DRA","Data Type":"Targeted Locus (Loci)","Organization":"Ecology and Evolution Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","Accession":"PRJDB12699","Title":"Honey bee larval and adult microbiome life stages are effectively decoupled with vertical transmission overcoming early life perturbations","experimentList":[["DRA013175","DRX322004"],["DRA013175","DRX322005"],["DRA013175","DRX322006"],["DRA013175","DRX322007"],["DRA013175","DRX322008"],["DRA013175","DRX322009"]]}

Ideally, the microbiome should be co-adapted with the host as well as their joint ecological niche. However, holometabolous insects, occupy different niches throughout development, with larva and adults being physiologically and morphologically distinct. Furthermore, the transition between the two stages usually involves the loss of the microbiome since the gut is intensively remodeled during pupation. Eusocial organisms appear to have evolved a workaround to this problem by sharing a communal microbiome, which inoculates newly eclosed adults. However, whether social microbiome transmission can fully overcome perturbations of the larval microbiome composition remains untested. We here used the honey bee (Apis mellifera) system to experimentally modify larval microbiomes to test if variations are mirrored in the later adult stage. We used ampliconsequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to test for changes in the bacterial community as well as mRNA sequencing to test for gene expression differences in larva as well as adult samples.	2023-07-25T09:02:10.000Z	{"Relevance":"","Center":"DRA","Data Type":"Other","Organization":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","Accession":"PRJDB11589","Title":"Decoupled honey bee microbiome stages and the role of social transmission"}
