PRJNA1307180,Host genetic background and social environment have different effects on the establishment and structure of the adult worker honey bee gut microbiota,"Many studies have highlighted the importance of gut microbiomes to many aspects of host physiology. Therefore, understanding how factors, such host genetics and social environment, impact the establishment and composition of the gut microbiota can provide insight into host biological functioning. Here, we controlled the microbial inoculation of honey bees across distinct social groups, each composed of a mixture of bees from three distinct genetic backgrounds, to determine the relative effects of host genetic background and social environment on the establishment and composition of the gut microbiota. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that host genetic background and social environment had effects on gut microbiome structure, with each influencing gut microbiome beta diversity. In addition, host genetic background and social environment each affected the abundance of different individual gut microbes. Together, these results suggest that host genetic background and social environment may play distinct roles in shaping the establishment and structure of host gut microbiota.",,NCBI

PRJNA1294982,"Host identity, more than elevation, shapes bee microbiomes along a tropical elevation gradient","Understanding how host-microbiome interactions respond to abiotic and biotic factors is key to elucidating the mechanisms influencing ecological communities under current climate change scenarios. Despite increasing evidence that gut microbial communities associated with bees influence their health and fitness, including key roles in nutrient assimilation, toxin removal, defense against pathogens, and immune responses, the distribution of gut microbial communities and the dynamics of these associations along environmental gradients remain poorly understood. In this study, we assessed how environmental changes with elevation and host taxonomic identity influence the bacterial gut microbiome of wild bees collected along a 3600 m elevation gradient in the Peruvian Andes. We applied DNA metabarcoding on the 16S region of gut samples from five bee tribes: Apini (honey bees), Bombini (bumble bees), Meliponini (stingless bees), Euglossini (orchid bees), and Halictini (sweat bees). Our findings indicate a general decrease in bacterial diversity and a high turnover of microbial taxa along the elevation gradient, with notable differences among host tribes. Host taxonomic identity was a strong predictor of gut microbial community composition, despite a high turnover of microbial and host taxa along the gradient. Within tribes, the turnover of microbial compositions was mainly explained by environmental changes with elevation in bumble and stingless bees. The observed variations in gut microbial diversity and composition at different elevations and different host taxa suggest that both factors significantly impact the gut microbiomes. As climate change continues to influence environmental conditions in the Andean-Amazonian forests it is crucial to consider how these changes may affect host-microbiome relationships. This highlights the necessity of understanding both abiotic and biotic factors in the context of climate change.",,NCBI
PRJNA1285920,Image-Based Honey Bee Larval Viral and Bacterial Diagnosis Using Machine Learning,"Honey bees are essential pollinators of ecosystems and agriculture worldwide. With an estimated 50-80% of crops pollinated by honey bees, they generate approximately $20 billion in market value in the U.S. alone. However, commercial beekeepers often face an uphill battle, losing anywhere from 40-90% of their hives annually, significantly impacted by brood diseases caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Accurate diagnosis of these brood diseases, especially distinguishing bacterial diseases like European Foulbrood (EFB) from viral infections with a superficial resemblance to EFB (EFB-like disease), remains challenging. Incorrect diagnoses often lead to prophylactic antibiotic treatment across entire apiaries, exacerbating antibiotic resistance, disrupting native gut microbiota, and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens. Correct field diagnosis of brood disease is challenging and requires years of experience to identify and differentiate various disease states according to subtle differences in larval symptomology. To explore the feasibility of an image-based AI diagnosis tool, we collaborated with apiary inspectors and researchers to generate a dataset of 2,759 honey bee larvae images from Michigan apiaries, molecularly verified through 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing and qPCR viral screening. Our dataset included EFB cases and viral infections (ABPV, DWVA, and DWVB), which were augmented to 8,430 and 8,124 images respectively. We leveraged transfer learning techniques, fine-tuning deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50v2, ResNet-101v2, InceptionResNet-v2) pre-trained on ImageNet to discriminate between EFB and viral infections. Our proof-of-concept models achieved 73-88% accuracy on the training/validation sets. When tested on an independent dataset from Illinois containing additional viral pathogens not present in training data, the models showed higher accuracy for EFB (72-88%) than viral infections (28-68%), highlighting both the promise and current limitations of this approach. Implementing AI-based diagnostic tools could reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatments and help maintain the microbiome integrity critical to colony health. However, expanding training datasets to include all major pathogens, healthy larvae, and diverse geographic regions will be essential for developing field-ready diagnostic tools.",,NCBI
PRJNA1253914,The relative importance of genetic distance and adult environment on the worker-worker similarity of gut bacterial microbiome and cuticular hydrocarbon profile in a sweat,"The cuticular hydrocarbon profile (CHC profile) and the gut microbiome are two crucial traits that shape the life of bees. The first plays an important role in inter- and intra-specific communication and the latter is essential for the development, nutrition and functioning of the immune system. In honeybees, CHC profile and gut microbiome finely interact: the chemical recognition cues are indeed partially defined by the characteristics of the gut microbiome shared, especially through trophallaxis, among sisters. However, most of the known eusocial bees show more primitive social traits, including moderate genetic relatedness among members of the colony often due to nest drifting or dispersal of workers, and lack of trophallaxis. Hence, primitively eusocial bees offer a great opportunity to evaluate the respective role of worker-worker genetic relatedness and of the environment in which the adult lives (residency nest) on the interaction between CHC profile and gut microbiome. Here, we investigated such relationships in the primitively eusocial digger bee Halictus scabiosae (Halictidae) by analyzing workers from 18 colonies across two Mediterranean nesting sites. We found a high rate of nest-drifting by workers, which leads to a consequent highly variable intra-colonial genetic relatedness. Despite often living in different, often distant nests as adults, workers which were genetically closer (including sisters raised in the same nest) possessed a more similar microbiome profile, but not a more similar CHC profile. Nest residency, indeed, was more correlated with CHC profile than with GM. Distances in microbiome profile and in CHC profile were correlated across workers, but even less of CHC is explained by genetic distance when the autocorrelation of GM is corrected for. Our results point towards an important influence of genetic distance on the gut microbiome, but not on the CHC profile, which is likely to be acquired from nestmates and nest material (i.e. adult environment). This ultimately resulted in a lack of genetic effect on the interaction between these two traits in this primitively eusocial bee.",,NCBI

PRJNA1248556,Experimental selection of honey bee gut microbiome,"This study investigates how selective pressures, specifically host lifespan and chronic exposure to the herbicide glyphosate, shape the composition and dynamics of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiome and host lifespan across generations. Using an experimental selection framework, microbiomes from bees with distinct lifespans and glyphosate exposure were serially transferred into germ-free hosts to assess microbial responses to selection and stress. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data generated provides insights into microbiome selection, resilience, and potential influence on host traits. This research is relevant for advancing our understanding of the microbiome's role in honey bee health and resilience to environmental stressors.",,NCBI
PRJNA1246220,"Geographic variation in bacteria, fungi and pollen associated with stem-nesting bees","The microbial composition of stored food can influence its stability and determine the microbial species consumed by developing organisms. Many bee species store nectar and pollen in provisions constructed to feed developing offspring. Previous work has shown variation in provision microbiome among bee populations, yet whether this variation is determined by the pollen types within provisions, variation between bee species at the same nesting sites, or geographic distance was unclear. Here, we sampled two species of co-occurring cavity nesting bees in the genus Osmia at 13 sites across the Sierra foothills in California and examined the composition of pollen, fungi and bacteria found in their provisions across sites. As expected, pollen, bacterial and fungal composition exhibited significant turnover between bees and sites, with bee species characterized by particular pollen and microbial species. Pollen composition explained 15% of variation in bacterial composition and ~30% of variation in fungal composition, whereas spatial distance among sites explained minimal additional variation. Symbiotic or bee-specialized microbe genera Ascosphaera, Sodalis and Wolbachia showed contrasting patterns of association with pollen composition, suggesting distinct acquisition and transmission routes for each. Comparing provisions from both species comprised of the same pollens points to environmental acquisition rather than bee species as a key factor shaping the early stages of the bee microbiome in Osmia. The patterns we observed also contrast with Apilactobacillus-dominated provision microbiome in other solitary bee species, suggesting variable mechanisms of microbial assembly in stored food among bee species.",,NCBI

PRJNA1232968,The gut microbiome of Hornets,"Hornet (Vespa spp.) are a large group of eusocial insect. Many species have a wide range of distribution, however some of them are expanded they colonization territory often through accidental human-mediated introductions to include non-native regions such as parts of Europe, South America, and North America for hornets of Asiatic origin. These species builds nests in soul or trees and preys on honey bees and other insects, raising concerns for apiculture, biodiversity, and even public health due to its contact with potential pathogens.</p><p>Recent research, has focused on their expanding impact. Factors such as climate change, urbanization, and weakened honey bee colonies have contributed to their increased predatory behavior, sometimes causing complete colony collapse. By examining hornets from various sampling sites ranging from apiaries to urban areas we aim to understand the composition of its gut microbiota and detect the presence of potential pathogens.

PRJNA1232403,Phage diversity mirrors bacterial strain diversity in the honey bee gut microbiota,"Bacteriophages (phages) play a crucial role in shaping bacterial communities, yet the relationship between phage and bacterial diversity remains poorly understood, particularly in animal-associated microbiomes. Here, we reconstructed the phage-bacteria interaction network in the gut microbiota of 49 honey bees by leveraging CRISPR spacer matches and genome homology. The resulting interaction network displayed a highly modular structure with nested phage-bacteria interaction within each module. Viral and bacterial alpha and beta diversity were correlated, particularly at the bacterial strain level and when explicitly considering the interaction network in diversity analysis. Overall, our results suggest that the most relevant approach to study phage-bacteria diversity patterns should rely on strain-level resolution and the explicit use of the interaction network. This offer an explanation as to why previous studies have failed to detect phage-bacteria diversity correlations. Finally, we call for further studies building up on these correlation patterns to probe the underlying mechanisms by integrating both bottom-up and top-down regulatory mechanisms in microbiome assembly.",,NCBI

PRJNA1221307,Gut microbiome of pesticide exposed Bombus vosnesenskii,"Wild pollinator declines are increasingly linked to pesticide exposure, yet it is unclear how intraspecific differences contribute to observed variation in sensitivity, and the role gut microbes play in the sensitivity of wild bees is largely unexplored. Here we investigate site-level differences in survival and microbiome structure of wild bumble bees exposed to multiple pesticides, both individually and in combination. We collected wild Bombus vosnesenskii foragers (N = 175) from an alpine meadow, a valley lake shoreline, and a suburban park and maintained them on a diet containing an herbicide (glyphosate), a fungicide (tebuconazole), an insecticide (imidacloprid), or a combination of these chemicals. Alpine bees had the highest overall survival, followed by shoreline bees then suburban bees. This was in part explained by body size differences across sites and the presence of conopid parasitoids at two of the sites. Notably, site of origin impacted bee survival on the herbicide, fungicide, and combination treatment. We did not find evidence of gut microbiome differences across pesticide treatment, nor a site by treatment interaction. Regardless, the survival differences we observed emphasize the importance of considering population of origin when studying pesticide toxicity of wild bees",,NCBI

PRJNA1203655,Evaluation of impact of agriculturally applied antibiotics to pollinator health,"On apple trees, streptomycin is applied to open flowers 2-3 times annually at the rate of 0.7 lb per acre to control fire blight (Erwinia amylovora). Application of these antibiotics often overlaps the flowering period of such crops and thus may have unintended adverse health effects on pollinators. There is a big knowledge gap regarding whether streptomycin applied to apple trees against fire blight is transferred to pollinating insects when they visit the treated flowers, and to what extent do the antibiotics affect their gut microbiome and health. The impact of antibiotics to pollinator health has been previously evaluated through a direct feeding of oxytetracycline to honey bees. The structure and diversity of the gut microbiome in bumble bees has been shown to play important roles in bee health. We identified several knowledge gaps in this area: 1. whether the residual concentration of agriculturally applied antibiotics to control plant pathogens would be potent enough to induce microbiome shift in bee gut, 2. whether the microbiome alteration would cause adverse impact to the bee health, 3. if microbiome is shifted upon antibiotic exposure, whether and how soon it is be restored after disturbance when antibiotics exposure is no longer there.",,NCBI

PRJEB79856,Core gut symbionts protect bumble bees from infection by a common bacterial pathogen,"Microbes shape the health of bumble bees, an important group of pollinators that includes many species of conservation concern. Most microbial research on bumble bees has focused on eukaryotic and viral pathogens or on the core gut microbiome. The latter refers to a community of host-specialized bacterial symbionts whose best-known function is protecting hosts against eukaryotic pathogens. However, bumble bees also harbor a third class of microbes: non-core gut bacteria, which are defined as being non-host-specific and variable among individuals. Understanding the functional role of non-core bacteria and how they interact with core symbionts could be important for bumble bee microbiome ecology and management. Here, we measured the prevalence of non-core bacteria in wild bumble bee workers (Bombus impatiens) and conducted lab experiments with gnotobiotic B. impatiens workers to examine factors shaping colonization by a focal non-core species (Serratia marcescens) and its consequences for bee health. We found that non-core bacteria, including Serratia, are highly prevalent in wild bumble bees, with roughly half of individuals harboring at least 10% non-core bacteria in their gut. Experiments showed that Serratia marcescens is more likely to colonize the gut when bees are young and the core gut microbiome is disrupted. Exposing bees with disrupted gut microbiomes to Serratia strongly reduced lifespan and reproduction, indicating that at least some widespread non-core bacteria include opportunistic pathogens. Overall, we provide evidence for protection against non-core bacterial pathogens as a previously undescribed function of the bumble bee core gut microbiome. Our work lays a foundation for monitoring and managing bumble bee gut health to limit core microbiome disruption and the invasion of bacterial pathogens.",,NCBI
PRJNA1146331,"The bacterial community throughout the life cycle and in the food of the Australian solitary bee, Megachile tosticauda","The bacterial associations in the food and throughout metamorphosis of the Australian, solitary, resin bee Megachile tosticauda are characterised. The bacterial community associated with M. tosticauda exhibited stability across two years of sampling, and adults, larvae and prepupae harboured distinct communities. We experimentally demonstrate that the adult microbiota are environmentally acquired and depend on the substrates encountered by the adults. Free-flying adult bees shared similar bacterial communities to pollen provisions, with Acinetobacter, a common nectar-associated taxon, dominating these samples. In larval provisions, the relative abundance of Acinetobacter decreases over time and was mostly absent in older brood, suggesting its potential consumption as food or a transient nature. Tyzzerella was prevalent in feeding larvae and prepupae, yet absent in adults. Antibiotic treatment of larval food supplies to remove live bacteria did not change brood developmental or survival, suggesting live bacteria may not be essential for larval growth. The combined observations indicate the gut microbiome is environmentally acquired, and that this species does not possess a heritable, functional gut microbiome.",,NCBI

PRJNA1138773,Microbiome of honey bees and Varroa mites in New Zealand,"The use of pesticides in beehives constitutes an important health issue for honey bees (Apis mellifera). Miticide treatments are not lethal to bees but could still impose significant sublethal costs. This study examined the impacts of amitraz on the bacterial communities of the honey bee gut and Varroa destructor mites. We sequenced and compared gut 16S rRNA composition pre- and post-amitraz treatment. Amitraz did not significantly influence bacterial gut communities in either honey bees or mites during the first six weeks following treatment. The gut bacterial community of bees was mainly dominated by the commonly observed microbiota in bees, which included species in the genera Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, and Frischella. Deformed wing virus (DWV) loads were analysed but were also unaffected by amitraz treatment over the six-week period analysed. The bacterial community of Varroa destructor mites was heavily dominated by Bartonella spp., in contrast to results observed elsewhere. Our results indicating that amitraz does not appear to affect honey bee microbiota should be helpful for beekeepers who rely on this pesticide for mite control.",,NCBI

While the symbiotic microbiome is well-studied in social bees, the role of environmental acquired microbiota in a solitary bees remains unclear. Assessing this relationship in a solitary pollinator, the leaf cutting bee, Megachile rotundata, we discovered that this bee species does not depend on the diverse environmental bacteria found in pollen for either its larval growth or survival. Surprisingly, high concentrations of the most abundant pollen bacteria, Apilactobacillus micheneri did not consistently benefit bee fitness, but caused larval mortality. Our findings also suggest an interaction between Apilactobacillus and the Sodalis and perhaps their role in bee nutrition. Hence, this study provides significant insights that contribute to understanding the fitness, conservation, and pollination ecology of other solitary bee species in the future.",,NCBI

PRJNA1114793,Investigating the Impact of Various Carbohydrates on the Longevity and Physiological Traits of Honeybees,"Carbohydrates play a crucial role as a primary energy source for honeybees, influencing their overall fitness and resilience. Given the potential implications for colony dynamics, foraging efficiency, and long-term survival, it is imperative to analyze the effects of various carbohydrates on honeybees. This study aimed to investigate the impact of diverse carbohydrate sources on honeybee longevity. Newly emerged honeybees were provided with a range of carbohydrates, including white sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, maltose, acacia honey, chestnut honey, and oligosaccharide at libitum, and their effect on honeybee longevity, size of hypopharyngeal glands, relative expression of ilp1, ilp2, and vg genes and the composition of honey bee gut microbiome were evaluated. Results revealed significant disparities in honeybee longevity, with the group fed corn syrup exhibiting the highest longevity, followed by acacia honey and white sugar syrup. Conversely, the group consuming oligosaccharide demonstrated the lowest longevity. Our research further explores the physiological and metabolic effects of different carbohydrate sources on honey bees. Bees fed corn syrup demonstrated significant development of hypopharyngeal glands, correlating with improved survival and longevity. Gene expression analysis revealed that corn syrup influenced insulin-like peptide (Ilp) levels, with Ilp1 expression being lower and Ilp2 expression higher in older bees, aligning with increased longevity. Additionally, shifts in gut microbiota were observed, with an increase in less dominant bacteria like Frischella and Rhizobiaceae (Bartonella), which may play a role in compensating for the lack of essential amino acids in the bees' diet. These findings underscore the complexity of honey bee nutrition, emphasizing the importance of balanced carbohydrate sources that cater to the bees' metabolic needs and support their overall health. The study highlights the potential of corn syrup as a viable alternative to traditional carbohydrate sources, offering insights for optimizing honey bee management and conservation strategies. Further research is needed to unravel the detailed mechanisms driving these nutritional interactions and their implications for colony health and resilience.",,NCBI

PRJNA1036403,"Unveiling climate- and resource-driven Variation in Bumble Bee Gut Microbiomes: Perspectives from Elevational Gradients, Colony Translocation, and Climate Chamber Experiments","Rising temperatures negatively affect bumble bee fitness directly through effects on physiology, but they may also disrupt mutualistic interactions between bees and other organisms, which ultimately determine species-specific response to climate change. Gut symbionts, key regulators of host nutrition and health, may be the Achilles' heel of thermal responses in insects. They not only modulate biotic interactions with plants and pathogens but also exhibit varying thermal sensitivity themselves. Understanding microbiome community disruption due to environmental change is a crucial first step to determine potential consequences for host population responses. Here, we analysed the gut bacteria communities of six bumble bee species inhabiting different climatic niches along an elevational gradient in the German Alpes, using 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing. We first investigated whether inter- and intraspecific differences in gut bacterial communities can be linked to species' elevational niches, which differ e.g., in temperature, flower resource composition and, likely, pathogen pressure. With a reciprocal translocation experiment, attempted between two distinct climatic regions within Germany, we then tested in B. terrestris and B. lucorum, how gut bacterial communities of bumble bee workers change in short-term when exposing colonies to new environments. Finally, we exposed these species to heat and cold wave scenarios within climate chambers to disentangle pure temperature-driven effects on the microbiome from other environmental effects. Species-specific microbiome characteristics indicated strong evolutionary influences on microbial associations. E.g., the loss of gut microbiome stability, characterized species inhabiting predominantly high and cooler elevations. Short-term adjustment of the gut microbiome to a warmer region was more subtle and characterized by an uptake of Lactobacillaceae. However, the gut microbiomes of these bumble bees did not change under laboratory temperature scenarios. Cumulatively, our data suggest that the gut microbiome is rather altered by climate-related environmental conditions rather than by temperature effects alone, with bumble bees response to climate change being determined by prevailing species-specific differences that co-evolve over time.",,NCBI

To solve this problem, we developed a one-step procedure that uses electroporation and homologous recombination, which we term SnODIFY (Snodgrassella-specific One-step gene Deletion or Insertion to alter FunctionalitY). We used SnODIFY to create seven single-gene knockout mutants and recovered mutants for all constructs tested. Nearly all transformants had the designed genome modifications, indicating that SnODIFY is highly accurate. Mutant phenotypes were validated through knockout of Type 4 pilus genes, which led to reduced biofilm formation. We also demonstrate inserting heterologous sequences into the genome by integrating fluorescent protein-coding genes. Finally, we confirmed that genome modification is dependent on S. alvis endogenous RecA protein. Because it does not require expressing exogenous recombination machinery, SnODIFY is a straightforward, accurate, and lightweight method for genome editing in S. alvi. This workflow can be used to study the functions of S. alvi genes and to engineer this symbiont for applications, such as protecting honey bee health.",,NCBI

PRJNA953189,gut microbiome disruptions,"Bumblebees are crucial for both natural ecosystems and agriculture, but their decline in distribution and abundance over the past decade is alarming. The global importance of bumblebees in natural ecosystems and agricultural food production cannot be overstated. However, the reported decline in their distribution and abundance over the past decade has led to a surge of interest in understanding and addressing bumblebee population decline. Based on the role of bacterial symbionts in bee health we aimed to detect disruptions in the gut microbiome of male and worker bumble bees reared indoor and outdoor to identify assess potential resilience to environmental stress. Using the Illumina MiSeq platform for 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the gut microbiome of male and worker bees that were raised indoors (designated as the IM and IW group) and those that were raised outdoors (also designated as the OM and OW group). Our results show presence of core bacteria Neisseriaceae, Orbaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae from indoor reared worker bees. However, higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and absence of Fructobacillus from indoor reared worker bees was also observed. Indoor-reared male bees had lower diversity and fewer observed OTUs compared to outdoor-reared bees. Additionally, the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes was significantly lower in indoor-reared males, while Proteobacteria was significantly increased. Despite this, we did not observe any dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of indoor-reared bumblebees when comparing the role of the gut symbionts among the groups. These results suggest that indoor-reared Bombus terrestris may be resilient to environmental stress when used as outdoor pollinators",,NCBI

Given the ecosystem functions performed by bees, and the declines faced by many species, it is important to improve our understanding of the amount of natural variation in the gut microbiome, the level of sharing of bacteria among co-occurring species (including between native and non-native species), and how gut communities respond to infections. We conducted 16S rRNA metabarcoding to discern the level of microbiome similarity between honey and bumble bee species in a suburban-rural landscape. We identified simple gut microbiomes dominated by bacterial taxa belonging to Gilliamella, Snodgrassella, and Lactobacillus. At the strain level, one G. apicola amplicon sequence variant (ASV 1) was widely shared across honey bees and bumble bees. However, we detected one G. apicola strain that was either exclusive to honey bees, or represented an intra-genomic 16S rRNA haplotype variant in honey bees. On the other hand, ASVs of S. alvi and Lactobacillus were more host specific, suggesting closer symbiotic relationships with their hosts. Honey bee bacterial microbiomes exhibited higher alpha diversity but lower beta and gamma diversities from those of bumble bees, a likely a result of the former possessing larger, perennial hives. Finally, we identified pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria that associate with Trypanosome and/or Vairimorpha infections in bees.",gut metagenome,NCBI

Brood parasitism however allows to distinguish between microbiome components horizontally transmitted by spill-over from the host with such inherited through vertical transmission by mothers. Here, we studied the bacterial gut microbiome of adults in seven aculeate species in four brood parasite-host systems: two bee-mutillid (host-parasitoid) systems, one halictid bee-cuckoo bee system and one wasp-chrysidid cuckoo wasp system. We aimed to test 1) whether host phylogeny correlates with bacterial gut microbiome composition, 2) whether brood parasites share components with their hosts, and 3) whether brood parasites show differences in bacterial diversity and specialization compared with respective hosts. Our results indicate that the bacterial gut microbiome of the studied taxa was species-specific, yet with a limited effect of phylogenetic relatedness and a major contribution of shared microbes between hosts and parasites. However, contrasting patterns emerged between bee-parasite systems and the wasp-parasite system. We conclude that the gut microbiome in adult brood parasites is largely affected by their host relationships and the similarity of trophic food sources between hosts and parasites.",,NCBI

Here we profiled the microbiome in returning forager bees from 10-12 hives in each of 6 apiaries across the southern half of Ireland, at early, middle and late time points in the 2019 season. Despite the wide range of geographical locations and forage available, apiary site was not the strongest determinant of the honey bee microbiome. However, there was clear clustering of the honey bee microbiome by time point across all apiaries, independent of which apiary was sampled. The clustering of microbiome by time was weaker although still significant in three of the apiaries, which may be connected to their geographic location and other external factors. The potential forage effect was strongest at the second timepoint (June-July) when the apiaries also displayed greatest difference in microbiome ecological diversity. We identified bacteria in the forager bee microbiome that correlated with hive health as measured by counts of larvae, bees, and honey production. These findings support the hypothesis that the global honey bee microbiome and its constituent species support thriving hives.",,NCBI

PRJNA809353,Honey bee core hindgut microbiome transmission does not require social interaction: The effect of diet and social exposure on tissue-specific microbiome assembly,"Honey bees are a model for host-microbial interactions with experimental designs evolving towards conventionalized worker bees. Research on gut microbiome transmission and assembly has examined only a fraction of factors associated with the colony and hive environment. Here we studied the effects of diet and social isolation on tissue-specific bacterial and fungal colonization of the midgut and two key hindgut regions. We found that both treatment factors significantly influenced early hindgut colonization explaining similar proportions of microbiome variation. In agreement with previous work, social interaction with older workers was unnecessary for core hindgut bacterial transmission. Exposure to natural eclosion and fresh stored pollen resulted in gut bacterial communities that were taxonomically and structurally equivalent to those produced in the natural colony setting. Stressed diets of no pollen or altered pollen in social isolation resulted in atypical microbiome structure and tissue-specific variation of functionally important core bacteria. However, no exposure to the active hive environment markedly reduced the abundance of both fungi and keystone species Gilliamella apicola in the ileum. These changes were associated with significantly larger ileum microbiotas suggesting that extended exposure to the active hive environment plays an antibiotic role in hindgut microbiome establishment. We conclude that core hindgut microbiome transmission is facultative horizontal with 5 of 6 core hindgut species readily acquired from the built hive structure and natural diet. Our findings contribute novel insights into factors influencing assembly and maintenance of honey bee gut microbiota and facilitate future experimental designs.",,NCBI

This study used 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing of pollen provisions and individuals of the small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, across stages of development to characterize the composition and diversity of bacteria and fungi in the microbiome. Pollen provisions and larval stages showed similar beta diversity, but differences in taxa composition. There was no significant decrease in diversity during the transition between larval and pupal stages that was expected post defecation. However, there were unexpected and progressive declines in diversity as development progressed from the early to late pupal stages, and again from the callow to adult stages. Bees across all stages lacked members of the Lactobacillus (now Apilactobacillus) genus, which has been shown in other studies to be part of the core bacterial community in C. calcarata and all bees. Three correlations between bacteria and fungi were found, suggesting common beneficial bacteria may protect the bees from prevalent fungal pathogens. Low alpha diversity, particularly in the later stages of development through adulthood, is concerning as the microbiome plays an important role in maintaining wild bee health.",,NCBI
PRJNA801280,A propolis-rich hive environment affects redox gene expression and microbiota at the individual and social level in honey bees,"The honey bee worker gut microbiome plays a critical role in host physiology including immunity, oxidative state and disease susceptibility. Here we investigated the effects of propolis (collected tree resin mixed with beeswax) on size and composition of gut microbiota, and host worker immune and redox gene expression. Using full-sized colonies, we prompted workers to collect tree resin creating a naturally propolis-rich colony/hive environment. Sampling pre-marked adult worker bees at 9-days post emergence revealed significantly larger populations of bacteria in the worker gut, but little change in the taxonomic composition or relative structure of the gut microbiome compared to propolis-poor colonies. Although immune gene expression in the fat body did not differ significantly, we found an overall trend towards decreased expression of immune genes in propolis-rich colonies. The expression of both pro-phenol oxidase and catalase were significantly reduced in the worker fat body suggesting that propolis augments host redox balance in individual workers. Consistent with clinical trials on human subjects, increased propolis levels resulted in greater expression of superoxide dismutase from both social head glands and the individual worker fat body. Assuming that social head gland secretions contribute to social immunity and net redox activity throughout the social environment, our results are consistent with a companion paper reporting drastic increases in beneficial native bacteria and reduced microbial diversity on the mouthparts, a primary marker of social interaction. Our study suggests that propolis supplementation has a net positive effect on host-microbial health at both individual and social levels, and through the upregulation of internal and socially secreted enzymes, may aid in the detoxification of biocides prevalent throughout the pollination environment.",,NCBI

It is part of a conserved microbiome that is composed of few core phylotypes and is essential for bee health and metabolism. Phylogenomic analyses using whole genome sequences of 75 Snodgrassella strains showed that they formed a monophyletic lineage within the Neisseriaceae family, that Snodgrassella isolates from Asian honeybees diverged early on from the other species in their evolution, that isolates from honeybees and bumblebees were well separated and that this genus consists of at least seven species. We propose to formally name two new Snodgrassella species that were isolated from bumblebees, i.e. Snodgrassella gandavensis sp. nov. and Snodgrassella communis sp. nov. Possible evolutionary scenarios for 107 species or group specific genes revealed very limited evidence for horizontal gene transfer of these genes.

PRJDB12699,Honey bee larval and adult microbiome life stages are effectively decoupled with vertical transmission overcoming early life perturbations,"Microbiomes provide a range of benefits to their hosts which can lead to the coevolution of a joint ecological niche. However, holometabolous insects, some of the most successful organisms on Earth, occupy different niches throughout development, with larva and adults being physiologically and morphologically highly distinct. Furthermore, transition between the stages usually involves the loss of the gut microbiome since the gut is remodeled during pupation. We here tested whether vertical microbiome transmission can overcome perturbations of the larval microbiome in honey bees (Apis mellifera). We manipulated the gut microbiome of in vitro reared larvae and after pupation inoculated the emerged bees with adult microbiome to test whether adult and larval microbiome stages may be coupled (e.g., through immune priming). We performed 16S ampliconsequencing to describe the bacterial community and mRNA sequencing to check for gene expression differences in larval as well as adult treatments. Larval treatments differed in bacterial composition and abundance, depending on diet, which also drove larval gene expression. Nonetheless, adults converged on the typical core taxa and showed limited gene expression variation. This work demonstrates that honey bee adult and larval stages are effectively microbiologically decoupled, and the core adult microbiome is remarkably stable to early developmental perturbations. Combined with the transmission of the microbiome in early adulthood, this allows the formation of long-term host-microbiome associations.",bee metagenome,NCBI

PRJEB48765,Fructobacillus in bumblebee microbiome,"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/1/98 Composition and stability of the gut microbiome are essential to maintaining a bumblebee's immune system and health. While bumblebees are key pollinators in agricultural landscapes, little is known about how gut microbial communities respond to anthropogenic changes. We used commercially produced colonies of buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) placed in three habitats. Whole guts (midgut, hindgut, and rectum) of B. terrestris specimens were dissected from the body and analyzed using 16S phylogenetic community analysis. We observed significantly different bacterial community composition between the agricultural landscapes (apple orchards and oilseed rape (Brassica napus) fields) and forest meadows, whereas differences in gut communities between the orchards and oilseed rape fields were nonsignificant. Bee-specific bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus, Snodgrassella and Gilliamella dominated gut communities of B. terrestris specimens. In contrast, the guts of B. terrestris from forest meadows were dominated by fructose-associated Fructobacillus spp., which may have been the result of high nectar concentrations in cold-climate-associated forest meadow flowers typical of the northernmost range of B. terrestris’s distribution. Bacterial communities of workers were the most diverse. At the same time, that of males and young queens were less diverse, possibly reflecting greater exposure to the colony's inner environment compared to the environment outside the colony, as well as bumblebee age. Our results suggest that habitat quality, exposure to environmental microbes, nectar quality and accessibility, and land use significantly affect gut bacterial composition in B. terrestris. This, in turn, may suggest survival and fitness implications for key pollinators.",,NCBI

A healthy gut microbiome is tied to central metabolism, provides protection from pathogens, aids in detoxification, and primes the immune system. Among the worker caste, age-based polytheism dictates the division of labor and is also integral to colony success. Independent of age, the honey bee worker can assume various physiological/behavioral roles based on colony needs. We investigated the disruption of worker age demographics on the ileum and rectum (hindgut) microbiomes, specifically, we forced foragers to revert to nursing; a task associated with youthful physiology. We hypothesized that the repeated consumption of pollen would result in oxidative stress and alterations to the microbiota. We found that the core hindgut microbiome remained relatively stable, with the exception of two putative opportunistic bacteria that differed by treatment. Associated with increased expression of prophenoloxidase (PPO) in reverted foragers, we observed the formation of diverticula in the midgut suggesting a loss of gut integrity. Collectively, our results suggest stability of the hindgut microbiome, but senescence of the midgut with reversion phenotypes becoming susceptible to septicemia.",,NCBI

These insect pollinators visit flowers repeatedly to collect nectar and pollen, which are shared with other hive bees to produce honey and beebread.

In this study, we have conducted a 16S rDNA ion torrent sequencing analysis on honey and beebread samples that were collected from 15 beehives in the southeast of England. We have confirmed that honeybee products carry a significant variety of bacterial groups that comprise bee commensals, environmental bacteria and pathogens of plants and animals. Remarkably, this bacterial diversity differs amongst the beehives, suggesting a specific fingerprint that is affected, not only by the nectar and pollen gathered from local plants, but also from other environmental sources.

Aging, climate and social gene expression are all expected to play a major role in disease susceptibility throughout the winter months. Here we used a marked cohort of known-age worker honey bees to investigate the integrity of mouthpart and midgut microbiomes of overwintering workers at 19, 33, 50, and 70 days of age. We quantified gene expression associated with oxidative stress and social immunity from a mouthpart associated secretory (hypopharygeal) gland that interfaces with the extended social environment on many levels. Our results provide the first evidence that social immune expression is associated with the core gut microbiota in honey bees, and highlights the midgut as a vulnerable tissue overwinter in warm southern climates. Results suggest many microbiota centric hypotheses including cooperation, competition, and social hygienic host response to hive opportunists. We discovered a distinct physiological and microbiological trajectory of southern diutinus (long-lived) workers that differs drastically from the younger, short-lived workers in the colony. Antioxidant gene expression in aging bees was associated with decreased fungal load on the mouth, increases in core microbiota and increased longevity. The cold indoor overwintering environment was associated with a small and stable midgut microbiota structure and stable gene expression overwinter. In contrast, warm outdoor overwintering was associated with changes co-occurring throughout the alimentary tract microbiota that suggest both disease presence and resistance in older workers, but increased disease susceptibility for younger workers that emerged during the winter, including increases in Enterobacteriaceae, fungal load and other bacterial opportunists. Our results highlight social selection pressures that shaped the microbiome with evolution to a perennial life history.",,NCBI
PRJNA735927,"Bee foraging preferences, microbiota and pathogens revealed by direct shotgun metagenomics of honey","Honeybees continue to succumb to human and environmental pressures despite their crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services. Owing to their foraging and honey production activities, honeybees form complex relationships with species across all domains, such as plants, viruses, bacteria (symbiotic and pathogenic), and other hive pests, making honey a valuable biomonitoring tool for assessing their ecological niche. The application of honey shotgun metagenomics has paved the way for a detailed description of the species honeybees interact with, in order to better assess the multiple factors governing their health. We describe the implementation of optimized honey DNA extraction methodology coupled to direct shotgun metagenomics (Direct-SM) analysis, and to a computationally optimised and validated pipeline for taxonomic classification of species detected in honey. By comparing honey collected across 3 harvesting seasons in a stable apiary, we show that Direct-SM can describe the variability of sampled plant species, revealing honeybee behavioural adaptation. We reveal that Direct-SM can non-invasively capture the diversity of species comprising the core and non-core bacterial communities of the gut microbiome. We show that this methodology is applicable for the monitoring of pathogens and particularly for the biomonitoring varroa infestation.

However, holometabolous insects, occupy different niches throughout development, with larva and adults being physiologically and morphologically distinct. Furthermore, the transition between the two stages usually involves the loss of the microbiome since the gut is intensively remodeled during pupation. Eusocial organisms appear to have evolved a workaround to this problem by sharing a communal microbiome, which inoculates newly eclosed adults. However, whether social microbiome transmission can fully overcome perturbations of the larval microbiome composition remains untested. We here used the honey bee (Apis mellifera) system to experimentally modify larval microbiomes to test if variations are mirrored in the later adult stage. We used ampliconsequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to test for changes in the bacterial community as well as mRNA sequencing to test for gene expression differences in larva as well as adult samples.",Apis mellifera,NCBI

PRJNA705676,The overwintering honey bee: Effect of age and climate on the hindgut microbiome- WW/CW samples,"Managed honey bee colonies are overwintered in a variety of climates. Successfully overwintered colonies are paramount to spring agricultural pollination demands, which provide nutrients for early-year colony growth. High rates of winter colony loss have prompted investigations into overwintering climate, including indoor climate controlled overwintering. Core to overall colony health, the gut microbiome has largely been ignored in this context. While the gut microbiomes of short-lived workers and long-lived queens have been investigated, that of intermediate-lived, overwintering (diutinus) workers is relatively unknown. We sequenced the hindgut microbiota of overwintering workers from both a warm southern climate and controlled indoor cold climate. A cohort of known chronological age was sampled congruently for comparison. Chronological age was associated with significantly decreased bacterial and fungal load, but the relative structure of the core hindgut microbiome did not change with age. In both climates, the hindgut microbiome was generally stable overwinter. However, collective microbiome changes in the southern climate suggest compromised host physiology. Fungal abundance increased by two orders of magnitude in southern climate hindguts and was positively correlated with non-core, likely opportunistic bacteria.

Modern commercial beekeeping is faced with a variety of pathogenic and environmental stressors often confounding attempts to understand recent colony loss. European foulbrood (EFB) is a larval disease whose causative agent, Melissococcus plutonius, has received limited attention due to methodological challenges in the field and laboratory. Here we improve the experimental and informational context of larval disease with the end goal of developing an EFB management strategy. We sequenced the bacterial microbiota associated with larval disease transmission, isolated a variety of M. plutonius strains, determined their virulence against larvae in vitro, and explored the potential for probiotic treatment of EFB disease. The larval microbiota was a low diversity environment similar to honey, while worker mouthparts and stored pollen contained significantly greater bacterial diversity. Virulence of M. plutonius against larvae varied markedly by strain and inoculant concentration. In the context of EFB infection in vitro, our chosen probiotic strain did not have a significant effect on larval survival. We discuss the importance of positive and negative controls for in vitro studies of the larval microbiome and disease.",,NCBI

PRJEB38245,Turnover of nest bacterial microbiome in nests of deceased red mason bees,"Solitary bees are subject to a variety of pressures that cause severe population declines. Currently habitat loss, temperature shifts, agrochemical exposure, and new parasites have been identified as major threats. Knowledge about detrimental bacteria is however scarce, although they may disturb natural microbiomes, nest environments or harm the larvae directly. To address this gap, we investigated 12 Osmia bicornis nests with deceased and 31 nests with healthy larvae from the same localities in a 16S rDNA metabarcoding study. We sampled larvae, pollen provisions, and nest material and then contrasted bacterial community composition and diversity in healthy and deceased nests. We identified three bacterial taxa assigned to Paenibacillus spp. (closely related to P. pabuli/amylolyticus/xylanexedens), Sporosarcina spp. and Bacillus spp. as indicative for bacterial communities of deceased larvae. Furthermore, we isolated the Bacillus sp. strain from a deceased larva and used it to inoculate the pollen provision of healthy larvae. Comparing the larval bacterial microbiota of treated individuals with control individuals, we observed strong microbiota changes and enhanced mortality. This underlines the need for further investigation of detrimental bacterial in solitary bees, to understand their impact on bee population dynamics and the importance of their natural microbiome for controlling pathogenic bacteria.",,NCBI

We installed O. lignaria cocoons at each site, allowed bees to emerge and forage, then collected them. We measured local features of gardens using vegetation transects and landscape features with GIS. We found that in microbiome composition between bee individuals varied by environmental features such as natural habitat, floral resources, and bee species richness.

Honey bees do not consume propolis but do manipulate propolis with their mouthparts.

PRJEB31610,Linking pollen foraging of megachilid bees to their nest bacterial microbiota,"Microbial profiling of the solitary bee nest environment is a challenging task due to the multiple aspects of the solitary bee ecology. Solitary bees build their nests by modifying the interior of natural cavities using various environmental materials and they provision them with food by importing collected pollen. As a result, the microbiota of the solitary bee nests depends on a variety of introduced materials. In order to characterize the extent to which introduced pollen affects the nest microbiome, we used metabarcoding of the ITS2 rDNA and the 16S rDNA to characterize the pollen composition and the bacterial communities of 100 solitary bee nest chambers belonging to seven megachilid species. Although the identity of each bee host species was the main driver of variance for the nest bacterial communities, pollen composition also had an effect on their structure. We found a weak correlation between bacterial and pollen alpha-diversity and significant interactions between the composition of pollen and that of the nest microbiota. This study contributes to the understanding of the association between foraging preferences and bacteria acquisition for solitary bees which cannot establish bacterial transmission routes through eusociality. This association may be essential for the successful offspring recruitment for this group of valuable pollinators.",,NCBI
PRJEB31847,Bee Pollination Modifies the Structure of the Seed Microbiota,"To date, little is known about the assembly of the seed microbiota. Some early microbial seed colonizers are transmitted from the maternal plant to the seed through the vascular system while other enter through the stigma. Thus, the seed microbiota, consists of microbes not only recruited from the vascular tissues of the plant, but also from the flower. Flowers are known to be a hub for microbial transmission between plants and insects. This floral-insect exchange opens the possibility for insect-transmitted bacteria to colonize the ovule and subsequently the seed, and to pass then into the next plant generation. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of insect pollination to the seed microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Brassica napus flowers were subjected to Apis and Osmia bee pollination, hand pollination or autonomous self pollination (ASP). Sequence analyses revealed that Apis pollination reduced the bacterial richness and diversity, increased the beta diversity amongst plants and introduced bee associated taxa. In contrast, Osmia pollination had minor effects on the seed microbiome. Insect pollination is therefore an ecological process involved in the transmission of bacteria from flower to seeds.",,NCBI

Propolis originates from a natural resinous mixture that honeybees collect from different plants sources and modify. By virtue of its antimicrobial properties, the main role of propolis is in the hygiene of the hive. Propolis has been considered relatively aseptic and as a result almost completely neglected from the point of view of its microbial community.</p><p>In this project we aim at describing the diversity of the microbial community of propolis by both cultivation and targeted-metagenomics analysis.",,NCBI
PRJEB27223,Microbiome community structure and succession in the nests of two megachilid bee genera,"Studies on honeybees have revealed bacterial taxa that are assumed to adopt key functions in the hive, in terms of nutrient uptake and immune responses. Despite the fact that solitary bees provide invaluable ecological services, the contribution of microbial communities to larval health, development and final fitness of adults is mainly unknown. To address this gap, we conducted a 16S meta-barcoding study including larvae and stored pollen in nest chambers from two different megachilid solitary bee genera. We tested how host taxonomy, environmental context and temporal stage during larval development determined the richness and composition of microbial communities. A total of 198 specimens of larvae as well as their pollen provisions from Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile rotundata and Megachile versicolor nests from different landscapes were investigated. Solitary bee microbiota in the nesting environment were much more diverse compared to eusocial bees and microbial communities were species-bound, rather than landscape dependent. We identified bacterial taxonomic units that showed consistent occurrence in the larvae and the pollen provisions within the same bee species and we unveiled others showing an abundance shift in line with progressing development and with that a dynamic change in overall bacterial community composition from egg-laying to hatching.",,NCBI
PRJNA494922,Characterisation of the UK honey bee metagenome,"The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) plays a major role in pollination and food production, but is under threat from emerging pathogens and agro-environmental insults. As with other organisms, honey bee health is a complex product of environment, host genetics and associated microbes (commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic). Improved understanding of bee genetics and their molecular ecology can help manage modern challenges to bee health and production. Sampling bee and cobiont genomes, we characterised the metagenome of 19 honey bee colonies across Britain. Low heterozygosity was observed in bees from many Scottish colonies, sharing high similarity to the native dark bee, A. mellifera mellifera. Apiaries exhibited high diversity in the composition and relative abundance of individual microbiome taxa. Most non-bee sequences derived from known honey bee commensal bacteria or known pathogens, e.g. Lotmaria passim (Trypanosomatidae), and Nosema spp. (Microsporidia). However, DNA was also detected from numerous additional bacterial, plant (food source), protozoan and metazoan organisms. To classify sequences from cobionts lacking genomic information, we developed a novel network analysis approach clustering orphan contigs, allowing the identification of Apicystis bombi, a parasitic gregarine. Our analyses demonstrate the power of high-throughput, directed metagenomics in agroecosystems identifying potential threats to honey bees present in their microbiota.",,NCBI
PRJEB23224,The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees,"The gut microbiome is increasingly recognised as playing an integral role in the health and ecology of a wide variety of animal taxa. However, the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age, and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over four days. The gut bacterial communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in-nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that core members of the unique honey bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results provide evidence for an influence of task related local environment exposure on the honey bee gut microbial community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.",,NCBI
PRJNA395063,Novel Interactions between Gut Microbiome and Host Drug-processing Genes Modify the Hepatic Metabolism of the Environmental Chemicals PBDEs,"Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been utilized for systems-based analysis of all liver samples. The goals of this study were to compare the hepatic transcriptome and PBDE metabolism between conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) mice. Methods: Livers from vehicle (corn oil), BDE-47, or BDE-99 treated adult male CV and GF mice were used for RNA-Seq (biological replicates: n=3 for CV corn oil, n=4 for CV BDE-47, n=2 for CV BDE-99, n=3 for GF corn oil, n=3 for GF BDE-47, and n=3 for BDE-99) using a HiSeq 2000 sequencer. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT v 0.1.6 beta; transcript abundance and differential expression were determined using Cufflinks (CuffDiff) v 2.2.1. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow,RNA-Seq generated approximately 47 to 68 million reads per sample, among which approximately 40 to 60 million reads were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome (NCBI GRCm/38/mm10). And we identified 393 drug processing genes in the livers of WT and hCAR-TG with with HISAT workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed that among all the 393 DPGs with known important functions in xenobiotic biotransformation, 90 DPGs were not expressed in livers of any groups (threshold: average FPKM < 1 in all treatment groups); whereas a total of 303 genes were expressed in livers of at least one groups, among which 258 DPGs were differentially regulated by mCAR or hCAR activation in either Day 5 or Day 60 (FDR-BH<0.05), and 45 genes were stably expressed among all treatment groups. Conclusions: Our study has unveiled a novel interaction between gut microbiome and the hepatic biotransformation of PBDEs, demonstrating that germ-free conditions modified the hepatic oxidation of PBDEs as well as the expression of relevant drug-processing genes in liver. Overall design: CV and GF male mice at the age of 9-weeks were treated with corn oil, BDE-47 (100umol/kg), or BDE-99 (100umol/kg) once daily for 4 consecutive days, and tissues were collected 24h after the final dose.

PRJNA321197,Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Raw sequence reads,"The importance of gut microbial communities for animal health has become increasingly clear. Early gut succession and diet-related shifts in bacterial community composition can be associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. Here we determined the effect of host niche and nutrient source on gut bacterial composition of the honey bee (Apis mellifera). We provided caged bees with naturally collected pollen and pollen substitute, both fresh and aged, then recorded host development and bacterial community composition of four nutrient-processing host niches. Feeding fresh pollen or fresh substitute, we found no difference in host mortality, consumption rate, development, or microbial community composition. In contrast, bees fed aged nutrition differed markedly, suffering impaired development, increased mortality, and developed a significantly different microbiome throughout the alimentary tract. Consuming an aged nutrient source resulted in a significant reduction of the core ileum bacterium Snodgrassella alvi and a corresponding increase of opportunistic pathogen Frischella perrara. Moreover, the relative abundance of S. alvi in the ileum was positively correlated with host survival and development. The inverse was true for F. perrara, reinforcing its role as an opportunistic gut pathogen. Echoing results from bumble bees, Parasacharibacter apium was also associated with negative host effects in general. Collectively, our findings suggest that the early establishment of S. alvi is associated with healthy nurse development, potentially excluding F. perrara and P. apium from the ileum. The pattern of dysbiosis in the ileum was reflected in the rectum, mouthparts and hypopharyngeal glands, suggesting a systemic physiological response.

Active manipulation of microbial communities towards the beneficial organisms has been observed for several Hymenoptera. This is achieved by inoculation with specific bacteria or treatment with antimicrobial substances. Most information about such associations is available for hive building organisms, and especially the honey-bee. There, manipulations especially result in a very restricted diversity of microbes present within the direct environment of their offspring. Currently, solitary bee nests have not been regarded according to microbial diversity, although their larvae face a very different situation from those of social bees and differences are to be expected. With this study, we assessed the bacterial biodiversity present in nests of Osmia rufa, the red mason bee, by culture-independent pyrosequencing. We found a high diversity not comparable to that in well tended hives of honey-bees. Although we identified a variety of potentially interacting organisms, positvely as well as negatively, most of the bacteria seem to originate from environmental sources through incorporated nest building material.
