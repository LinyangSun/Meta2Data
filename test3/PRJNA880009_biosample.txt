Description:
The honeybees were collected from a hive of the University of Wuerzburg. They were transferred into cages, which were maintained in an incubator (30°C, 50% humidity) for one week. The food was provided via Eppendorf cups that were prepared with little holes at the bottom. As a bee was expected to consume 60µl liquid per day, the amount of food per cage was adapted to the number of individuals, so that the bees could feed ad libitum. Each day, the Eppendorf cups were removed and replaced by new ones, so that a controlled and fresh food supply could be guaranteed. The feeding solutions were calculated on the basis of residue levels found in the field, which resulted in a concetentration of 10 µg*l-1  Cantus® Gold and 200 µg*l-1  Mospilan®  solved in 30% sugar water solution (based on sucrose).

Description:
The honeybees were collected from a hive of the University of Wuerzburg. They were transferred into cages, which were maintained in an incubator (30°C, 50% humidity) for one week. The food was provided via Eppendorf cups that were prepared with little holes at the bottom. As a bee was expected to consume 60µl liquid per day, the amount of food per cage was adapted to the number of individuals, so that the bees could feed ad libitum. Each day, the Eppendorf cups were removed and replaced by new ones, so that a controlled and fresh food supply could be guaranteed. The feeding solutions were calculated on the basis of residue levels found in the field, which resulted in a concetentration of 10 µg*l-1  Cantus® Gold solved in 30% sugar water solution (based on sucrose).

Description:
The honeybees were collected from a hive of the University of Wuerzburg. They were transferred into cages, which were maintained in an incubator (30°C, 50% humidity) for one week. The food was provided via Eppendorf cups that were prepared with little holes at the bottom. As a bee was expected to consume 60µl liquid per day, the amount of food per cage was adapted to the number of individuals, so that the bees could feed ad libitum. Each day, the Eppendorf cups were removed and replaced by new ones, so that a controlled and fresh food supply could be guaranteed. The feeding solutions were calculated on the basis of residue levels found in the field, which resulted in a concetentration of 100 µg*l-1  Steward® solved in 30% sugar water solution (based on sucrose).
